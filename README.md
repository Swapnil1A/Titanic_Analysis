# Titanic_Analysis

Successfully Done with the Task 1 as a "Data Science Intern" at "Prodigy Infotech"


Description of the Task : Titanic Dataset

1. The Python Libraries used for the Project were Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
2. The Analysis of the Project starts with the importing of the dataset present in the csv Format.
3. Firstly, we detect the null values in the dataset followed with columns and shape detection.
4. Also, we determine the Data_type of the given Columns and carried out the analysis accordingly.
5. The correlation between various columns is determined and also drawn it's Heatmap accordingly.
6. Explore relationship between various Data_Columns using Matplotlib and Seaborn Library Graphically.
7. The Graphs used were countplot, pairplot, pieplot, boxplot and barplot.

   Hence, analysis of above dataset helps in exploring various features of data and also came to know about various insights 
   from the Dataset.
